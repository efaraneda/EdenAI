This is an Open Source project, inspired in this work https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents and the biblical tale of the Eden Garden.

The scope includes a 2 agent virtual world (Adam and Eve), powered by open source LLMs, a small set of prohibited behaviors, a mechanism to "procreate" an concibe new agents. There are going to be temptations.

We will give naive personalities to all agents and we will let them make their own decisions, to find out how long does it take for them to grow in population and get corrupted. We will design a method to talk in a god-like manner to agents.
